            <p>Hi, my name is Laurie. I am originally from central lower Michigan, however, Marquette has been my home for the last 12 years. I have enjoyed raising my children up here in the UP. I enjoy spending time with my husband and kids doing outdoor activities such as mountain biking and hunting. I am the proud owner of Opalus Salon and have been in the industry for 8 years. In addition to all the usual hair services I have been doing eyelash extensions for 4 years and was the first Novalash expert in Marquette. I love getting to know people. Your combined comfort and satisfaction is my number one goal and I have created my salon with those aims in mind. From comfortable chairs and warm surroundings to complimentary coffee, tea, pop and WiFi, I want you to feel at home. My prices are competitive and I offer Senior and student discounts. I think we may provide a value above and beyond what youâ€™ve experienced elsewhere. We are conveniently located in the heart of Marquette on Third street across from Down Wind Sports and next to Yooper Shirts with parking specifically for our clientele.</p>
